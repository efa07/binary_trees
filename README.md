## Description

This repository includes a variety of projects that cover the creation, manipulation, and traversal of binary trees. The projects aim to deepen understanding of this fundamental data structure and provide hands-on experience with tree-based algorithms.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific task or concept related to binary trees. Below is a brief overview of the directories and their contents:

* 0-binary_tree_node.c: Function to create a new binary tree node.
* 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c: Function to insert a node as the left child of another node.
* 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: Function to insert a node as the right child of another node.
* 3-binary_tree_delete.c: Function to delete an entire binary tree.
* 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: Function to check if a node is a leaf.
* 5-binary_tree_is_root.c: Function to check if a node is the root.
* 6-binary_tree_preorder.c: Function to traverse a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
* 7-binary_tree_inorder.c: Function to traverse a binary tree using in-order traversal.
* 8-binary_tree_postorder.c: Function to traverse a binary tree using post-order traversal.
* 9-binary_tree_height.c: Function to measure the height of a binary tree.
* 10-binary_tree_depth.c: Function to measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.
* 11-binary_tree_size.c: Function to measure the size of a binary tree.
* 12-binary_tree_leaves.c: Function to count the leaves in a binary tree.
* 13-binary_tree_nodes.c: Function to count the nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
* 14-binary_tree_balance.c: Function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.
* 15-binary_tree_is_full.c: Function to check if a binary tree is full.
* 16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c: Function to check if a binary tree is perfect.
* 17-binary_tree_sibling.c: Function to find the sibling of a node.
* 18-binary_tree_uncle.c: Function to find the uncle of a node.
* 
Each directory contains source code files (.c), header files (.h), and README.md files specific to the tasks within that directory.
